# kafka-flink-springboot-kubernetes-demo-project
demo project using flink, kafka, springboot and kubernetes

Before you deploy this project. You need to have basic knowledge on these components and know how to deploy applications on remote kubernetes cluster. 

All kubernetes deployment configuration files are under app/kube

I borrow the idea from this repository https://github.com/patrickneubauer/kafka-flink-kubernetes-example
